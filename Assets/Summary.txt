Hi all.

  On this test, my focus was divided, between displaying things on screen and keep them performant.
  I tried to keep the memory usage low due to the target platform being a mobile device, i did it by limiting the entries shown at a time.
  On the bonus task, i didn't query dynamically, but that would be an easy process to add. I could also add a storage system for the downloaded texture, but it was going to be a bit more time-consuming so i decided not to do that.
  
  In terms of UI animations, there was a lot it could be done, such as: 
   - FadeIN entries on element add;
   - Make the Details panel appear from the pressed item, instead of appearing from the center;
   
  For the animation i used DoTween, since using animator on UI has a strong performance impact.
  
  The improvements if given more time it would be:
   - Improve add and remove of entries when scrolling;
   - Take more time on the details panel.
